# Eyeroll ðŸ™„

Eyeroll is a WebExtension for Firefox that let's you scroll webpages by blinking your eyes. Close your right eye to scroll down, and your left eye to scroll up. It's great for scrolling chords without leaving your instrument, or reading the news while you're brushing your teeth! Eyeroll works 100% on your device and works on Firefox for Android too.

## Install

- [Firefox for Android](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/android/addon/eyeroll/)

## Usage

After installing the addon, simply press the icon on the toolbar to enable Eyeroll. Your video will appear at the bottom right. You can now start scrolling with your eyes.

By default, you can also enable Eyeroll with `Ctrl`+`Alt`+`E`.

The addon preferences lets you set the blinking sensitivity, the time your eye needs to be shut before the scroll happens, and the size of the video preview.
